# Assignment2

### Run & Requirements Installation
In order to install and run the assignment follow the instruction below:
Note that there is a need to install python3.6 and pip3 (package manager):

    git clone https://github.com/WASP-AS1-Umea/assignment2
    pip3 install -r req.txt

Then either run the Jupyter notebook (requires that you have `jupyter-notebook` installed):

    jupyter-notebook Human_Activity_Detection-DNN.ipynb

or just run the python script:

    python3.6 main.py

These two run the same code but the Jupyter notebook contains documentation and
an explanation of what we are doing, making it easier to follow.
